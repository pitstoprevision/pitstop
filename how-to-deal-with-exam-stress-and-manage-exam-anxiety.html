<h2>How to deal with exam stress and manage exam anxiety</h2>

<p>Have you ever been in a position where you’ve spent aaages studying for an exam, then when you sit down and read that first question your mind goes blank and it’s like you wasted your time and don’t remember a single thing and you feel like you’re gonna fail and you start to spiral and you think “oh my days why is this happening” and then your hand starts cramping and shaking so much that you struggle to write and you might even sweat a lot. Yeah, that sounds like exam anxiety. Your thoughts may go like that first sentence; on and on where there seems to be no end. </p>
<p>Anxiety is a horrible feeling, it’s one of the most difficult emotions to deal with because it takes over your physical state. Heart racing, hands shaking, tightness in the chest, maybe some struggles breathing. My experience in particular involved coughing from the moment I woke up to the minute I left the front door on the day of an exam. The coughing was always completely out of my control, but the more I had to deal with it the better I got at, well, dealing with it. </p>
<p>Here are some tips for you to reduce stress and anxiety symptoms when you’re doing a test or leading up to one.</p>
<p>1. You're not as stressed if you're well prepared</p>
<p>Part of the reason why you may feel anxiety before an exam is because there’s a part of you that may doubt your work. “I don’t know if I’ve done enough” or dreading a particular question is not a thought or position you want to be in. Making sure that you’re confident that you’ve done absolutely every possible thing to better your chances, and reminding yourself that in the moment (easier said than done) or after can ease the fear. Even if it’s just a little. </p>
<p>2. Establish a routine</p>
<p>The thing about exam days is that they’re structured completely differently to the rest of your days. The day itself feels different. Having a routine that you do every morning regardless of if it’s exam day or not can help make things feel a little more normal. As opposed to thinking “oh no it’s exam day” which you’re going to think anyway, you can still do the usual “eat coco pops and watch netflix” routine to give a bit of normalcy to the day. You can even take it to the point of having a routine when you sit down and start studying (like arranging your pens in a particular way) and doing the same before opening the test paper. The less you spend thinking and worrying, the better you’ll be.</p>
<p>3. It's going to be okay.</p>
<p>Anxiety is caused by thoughts that can’t be helped. I’d say a lot of the time it comes from fear. Fear of failure mostly, but it could be fear of the environment, fear of letting down yourself or family, fear of being deemed as “not good enough” by someone/people you care about. So I want you to know, it’s going to be okay. I’m not saying you shouldn’t care or work hard towards your exams. But I promise you it’s not the end-all-be-all. You’re still going to go home and have to eat lunch/dinner, you’ll still go on holidays, you’ll still get a job and move out. Everything is going to be fine. What you need to get good at, is saying it to yourself and believing it. </p>
<p>Do you know the best way to get over a fear? Just do the thing you’re scared of. Wow is that hard to do, but it really is the best way. Jump head first into whatever you’re scared of and stay in it until you have that “oh this isn’t so bad” thought. </p>
<p>Just know this, your grades don’t determine the rest of your life. You do. If you don’t get the results you want for whatever reason, that’s fine. Pivot, adjust and go full force at the next thing. You can’t guarantee outcome, but you can guarantee effort. Max effort is non-negotiable. If it doesn’t work out afterwards then it wasn’t meant to be. </p>
