<h2>THE best revision tip for gcse and alevel exams</h2>
<p>
    There’s one word that comes to mind that outweighs every other tip you may have gotten, confidence. The more confident you are going into anything, especially an exam, the better your outcome will be. Because with confidence comes comfort, and with comfort comes peak performance.
</p>

<p>Being comfortable in an exam comes from different sources. The main being full understanding of what you’re being tested on. Imagine going to a heart surgeon and asking them questions about heart anatomy, they’ll tell you what they know as if they’ve seen thousands of them and know each and every bit by heart (because they probably have). That doesn’t mean you need to do thousands of questions on a topic or read an extract a thousand times, but you want to be so good at a particular topic others think you’ve seen it thousands of times. </p>

<p>How do you do that? Explain it to someone that knows nothing about it and do it as simply as you can, or pretend to. 

    “If you can’t explain it simply,  you don’t understand it well enough” - Albert Einstein</p>
 

<p>Practising questions, and specifically exam questions, is so important. The questions in an exam might be different in wording or structure, you don’t want to learn that when it matters most. Take some time to do past papers or exam worksheet questions (you can find that on the home page) and look at the mark schemes afterwards. Get an idea of the structure and wording, figure out what they want you to write down for what topic, identify any patterns that you can. “Oh I need to make xyz point whenever I see abc topic.

<p>The other way you get comfortable in exam settings comes from actually doing exams. The more you do them, the better you’ll get. But you don’t have to wait till them. Nothing will be the same as being in that hall and sitting your actual GCSE’s or A-Levels, but that doesn’t mean you can’t simulate that level of stress. Practise the exam environment at home. Zero noise, zero distractions, time limit. Study like that every time you sit down. That way when you open that first page it’ll feel similar to revising. Can’t do that at home? Go to the library. Oh, it’s too far? Take the bus or bike or walk. Can’t go to the library? Stay back after school for another hour and get work done. There’s always an option. </p>

<p>Focus on building confidence in as many ways as possible. You’ll definitely be nervous but you want that to die the minute you open the paper and read the first question. You want to enter a flow state, make your way through the exam and walk out knowing you did everything you could to maximise your grade. It takes work, but the work has got to be done. And I promise you, it’s worth it.
