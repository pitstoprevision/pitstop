<h2>Answering ‚Äúhow do I revise for gcse‚Äôs or a-levels?‚Äù based on 14+ years of experience</h2>
<p>
    I‚Äôve received my GCSE‚Äôs, A-Levels, Degree and have 7+ years of tutoring experience. If anyone knows how to properly prep for exams, I like to think it‚Äôs gonna be me üòÖ. Here‚Äôs everything you need:
</p>

<p><u>Maths and Sciences</u></p>

<p>Super simple, just do questions. Honestly, throughout the year just keep doing questions from the book that you use. At the end of each topic test yourself with exam questions (https://pitstoprevision.co.uk - find our worksheets here). Before mocks try some past papers, but start with the old-ish ones. This will give you the practise you need without using up your best resources. Then come exam time do the more recent past papers, these will be your best reference as to what you can expect in your exam. Throughout the years content and structure can vary slightly so the papers within the last 3 years will be the ones most similar to the exam you‚Äôll sit.</p>

<p>The best way to think about it is like this: the book questions help you solidify your content, worksheets help you identify what you do and don‚Äôt know according to exam questions and past papers fine tune the details. The more time you spend doing questions and applying what you know, the better off you‚Äôll be and the more confidence you‚Äôll have walking into that exam. </p>

<p><u>English and Humanities</u></p>
<p>Unlike Maths and Science, English and the humanities subjects like History, Geography and Economics are going to be done a little differently. </p>
<p>Being essay based subjects the techniques and structure of the exams and your answers have to change compared to studying Maths and Science. It‚Äôll involve more case study knowledge and break down, along with a little more fact based knowledge with some application. Making sure you‚Äôve practised extract/case study analysis whilst applying proper essay structure is key to a lot of these subjects. Planning essays according to each topic can help you be better prepared for any long question that you may be hit with. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs not all regurgitation though because you‚Äôll also have to demonstrate understanding of certain concepts in the case of Geography and Economics for example. Making sure you‚Äôre able to explain these in writing is difficult to do, so try explaining verbally to a friend first who can check to see if you‚Äôve hit all the main points. Then have them written down as bullet points in notes or a flash card, then transfer into full sentence writing. </p>
<p>There are different learning and revision techniques that work for different people. Mind maps and flash cards have worked wonders for some but not for others. Some people can just read and understand where others prefer a cartoon or labelled diagram. Which one is best for you will come down to some experimenting, try different ones and see which you click with whilst practising book/exam questions throughout the year. Then come exam time, you know which technique to go full force with!</p>
