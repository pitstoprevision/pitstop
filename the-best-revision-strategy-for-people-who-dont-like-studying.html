<h2>The best revision strategy for people who don't like studying</h2>

<p>I get it, studying sucks. It’s boring, takes forever, sometimes makes you want to rip your hair out and overall just bleugh. So imagine having to sit down and study for hours every day either because you have a test coming up or a lot of homework to do or deadlines. </p>
<p>Your trick is simply a change of perspective. Meaning, don’t think “I need to sit and study for … hours” or any sort of time period. Instead focus on how much you’re going to get done and then stick to it! (this strategy doesn’t work without the accountability). If you set up your study period in terms of content covered, regardless of how long it takes you, you’ll find it so much easier to keep on top of your tasks. </p>
<p>Once you’ve finished your to-do list for the day, you can chill. And it’ll be even better because you would’ve earned it! This for me changed things massively. Because I went from needing to “sit and study (🤢) for 3 hours” to needing to do “only 2 chapters and a few questions”. I reiterate, this only works if you keep yourself in check and stick to what you plan to do!</p>
<p>If you struggle to keep up with tasks, or prefer things to be neatly laid out, you can find the different templates I’ve made to help with exactly that:</p>
